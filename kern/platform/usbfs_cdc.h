/* usbfs_cdc.h - CH32V307 USBFS CDC-ACM debug console (kernel side).
 *
 * The board's USART1 pins (PA9/PA10) have no electrically connected debug
 * channel (R20/R34 0-ohm optionals unpopulated), so the kernel runs a small
 * USBFS device stack instead: the chip's own USB connector turns into a CDC
 * ACM serial port on the PC (/dev/ttyACM*), and every app-side putc is
 * mirrored through S3K_SYSCALL_DBG_PUTC (63) into a kernel-side ring that
 * is drained onto EP3 (bulk IN).
 *
 * All state and code is kernel-side: M-mode ring, endpoint buffers and the
 * controller registers themselves. No physical wiring is needed.
